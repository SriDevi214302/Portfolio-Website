# Portfolio-Website
A simple personal portfolio website built using HTML (and CSS in progress). It includes sections such as Home, About Me, Skills, Projects, and Contact. This project is created as part of my Python Full Stack course to practice frontend development concepts and will be updated with CSS and JavaScript in future versions.
